# WTF-World2
Well It seems that the World is in a place that need a second WTF?
I hope to still add profound insights.
However if it seems the World is not listening...
I may keep my insights to myself.

Insight 1:
Choice is not always a good thing.  Particularly when others are dictating the options.
